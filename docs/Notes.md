# Notes for the questions I have

1. The distances provided in the “WGUPS Distance Table” are equal regardless of the direction traveled.

 Due to the distances being equivalent regardless of the direction travel [1], this would be considered an undirected graph. This means that the edges between the nodes are bidirectional, and the weight of the edges is the same in both directions [1].

2. How do I implement the ingestion process for the excel file? According to Professor Denshy  I'm going to need to convert it into a CSV, tidy it up, and then ingest from there.
