## xxHash Development and Integration for MuxMuxHashTable

### To Do
- [ ] **Adapt xxHash for Enhanced ACO Heuristic Information Performance**:
      Tailor the xxHash algorithm to better suit the dynamic and complex nature of ACO heuristic data, aiming for minimal computational overhead and maximized retrieval speed.

- [ ] **Empirical Collision Rate Analysis with Murmur3 in Double Hashing**:
      Systematically quantify and analyze collision rates when xxHash is paired with Murmur3 within our double hashing framework, aiming to fine-tune parameters for collision mitigation.

- [ ] **Prime Constants and Seed Values for xxHash**:
	  Use the `Sieve of Atkin` algorithm to generate prime constants and seed values for xxHash.

	```python
    prime_array = []
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++):
    if sieve_of_atkins(random_number in range(1, 65536)):
    prime_array.push(prime)
    ```
	  
- [ ] **Fine-tune xxHash Parameters for the ACO Implementation Context**:
      Undertake a thorough examination and experimentation with xxHash's prime constants and seed values to fine-tune its hashing distribution, particularly in the context of the ACO heuristic information, ensuring an optimal balance between speed and distribution.

### In Progress
- [ ] **Debug and Logging**:
	  Implement debugging and logging mechanisms to monitor Murmur3's performance and identify any potential issues or inefficiencies.

### Done
- [x] **Implement xxHash Algorithm as a Static Class**:
      The xxHash algorithm has been successfully encapsulated within a static class framework, ensuring its modular integration and reusability within the MuxMuxHashTable and potentially other components requiring efficient hashing.

- [x] **Validate xxHash Efficiency Across Diverse Data Volumes**:
      Completed extensive validation of xxHash's performance across a broad spectrum of input data sizes, confirming its high efficiency and robustness. The testing confirmed xxHash's **O(n)** time complexity, where **n** is the length of the input, aligning with its theoretical performance metrics.

- [x] **Integration of xxHash as a Secondary Hash Function in the MuxMuxHashTable**:
      Achieved seamless integration of xxHash as the secondary hash function within the MuxMuxHashTable's double hashing strategy. 

	- **Leveraged benefits**:  
		- Inherent rapid computation 
		- Excellent distribution properties 

	- **Asymptotic Runtime and Efficiency**: The integration of xxHash, in conjunction with Murmur3, allows our double hashing technique to achieve **O(1)** average-case runtime for key operations, significantly enhancing the MuxMuxHashTable's efficiency in handling ACO heuristic information.
