# Stage 3: Core ACO Components

## Goals:
Develop and integrate the essential mechanisms of the ACO algorithm that enable ants to explore, evaluate, and enhance delivery routes through pheromone signaling. This stage is crucial for the algorithm's ability to converge on efficient solutions for package delivery.

## Tasks:

### 1. Ant Colony Initialization

- [ ] **Ant Entity Definition**: Define an `Ant` class with attributes for current location, visited nodes, and the current solution's cost.

- [ ] **Colony Setup**: Initialize a set of ants, distributing them across starting nodes based on strategic considerations or randomly.

- [ ] **Ant Movement Mechanism**: Implement methods allowing ants to move from one node to another within the graph.

### 2. Path Selection

- [ ] **Probabilistic Decision Rule**: Code the decision-making process for ants, allowing them to choose the next node based on a combination of pheromone intensity and heuristic desirability.

    - [ ] **Desirability Function**: Develop a function that computes the desirability of moving to a given node, incorporating heuristic information and pheromone levels.

- [ ] **Exploration vs. Exploitation Balance**: Introduce parameters to balance exploration of new paths with exploitation of known good paths.

### 3. Pheromone Update Mechanism

- [ ] **Pheromone Deposition**: Create a method for ants to deposit pheromones on paths they traverse, with the amount possibly depending on the quality of the solution.

- [ ] **Pheromone Evaporation**: Implement global pheromone evaporation, reducing all pheromone levels over time to avoid premature convergence.

- [ ] **Pheromone Update Schedule**: Determine and implement the timing of pheromone updates (e.g., after each ant's tour or after all ants complete their tours).

### 4. Local Search (Optional)

- [ ] **Local Optimization**: If applicable, incorporate a local search mechanism to refine solutions found by ants, such as 2-opt or 3-opt techniques for route improvement.

- [ ] **Integration with ACO**: Ensure that the local search process interacts properly with the ACO components, enhancing solution quality without disrupting the pheromone-guided exploration.

### 5. ACO Component Testing

- [ ] **Unit Testing for ACO Components**: Conduct detailed tests for each new component (path selection, pheromone update, local search) to verify their correct operation.

- [ ] **Component Interaction Tests**: Verify that ACO components work together harmoniously, ensuring that ants can effectively explore the graph, deposit and respond to pheromones, and improve their solutions.

## Deliverables:

- A functional ant colony capable of exploring the delivery network graph and building solutions for package delivery.

- Implemented decision-making processes that guide ants in selecting paths based on heuristic and pheromone information.

- A dynamic pheromone update system that supports the iterative improvement of delivery routes.

- Optional: An integrated local search mechanism for solution refinement.

- Comprehensive testing documentation, demonstrating the functionality and interaction of ACO components within the WGUPS system.
