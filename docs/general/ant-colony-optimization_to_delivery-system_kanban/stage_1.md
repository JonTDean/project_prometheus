# Stage 1: Research and Preparation

## Goals:
The primary objective of this stage is to lay a solid foundation for the ACO algorithm's development by acquiring a thorough understanding of its principles, mechanics, and potential applications within the WGUPS delivery system. This stage aims to ensure that the algorithm's adaptation is well-informed and strategically aligned with the delivery system's requirements and constraints.

## Tasks:

### 1. Study ACO Fundamentals

- [ ] **Literature Review**: Identify key scholarly articles, textbooks, and online resources that cover ACO algorithms. Focus on sources that detail graph representation, pheromone mechanics, and heuristic strategies.

- [ ] **Algorithm Analysis**: Examine the standard components of ACO algorithms, including ant agents, pheromone trails, heuristic values, and the decision-making process. Understand how these components interact to solve optimization problems.

### 2. Analyze Requirements

- [ ] **Requirement Gathering**: Compile a comprehensive list of WGUPS delivery constraints and requirements. Include truck capacities, speed limitations, delivery deadlines, and any special instructions associated with packages.

- [ ] **Constraint Analysis**: Break down each requirement to understand its implications for route optimization. Identify which constraints could be directly managed by ACO and which may require additional logic or adaptations.

- [ ] **System Mapping**: Create an initial sketch or conceptual model of how ACO could integrate with the existing WGUPS system. Consider where the algorithm would make decisions, how it would receive data, and where its outputs would be applied.


## Deliverables:

- A documented analysis of WGUPS requirements and how ACO could address these within the constraints provided.
