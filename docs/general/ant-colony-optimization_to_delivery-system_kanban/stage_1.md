# Stage 1: System Modeling

## Goals:
The aim of this stage is to construct a detailed and functional representation of the WGUPS delivery network and initialize the core structures of the ACO algorithm. This involves setting up a graph to represent the delivery area, initializing a pheromone matrix to track path desirability, defining ant solutions, and preparing heuristic information storage. The completion of this stage will result in a robust framework ready for the implementation of the ACO algorithm's core logic.

## Tasks:

### 1. Graph Representation

- [ ] **Adjacency Matrix Creation**: Develop an adjacency matrix to represent the delivery network, using distances from the "WGUPS Distance Table".

    - [ ] **Data Extraction**: Extract distance data from the WGUPS Distance Table and format it for matrix inclusion.

    - [ ] **Matrix Implementation**: Code the adjacency matrix, ensuring that it accurately represents distances between locations.

- [ ] **Graph Validation**: Test the graph representation for accuracy by comparing calculated distances against known values from the distance table.

- [ ] **Visualization (Optional)**: Create a visual representation of the graph to aid in understanding and debugging.

### 2. Pheromone Matrix Initialization

- [ ] **2D Array Setup**: Implement a 2D array structure to hold the pheromone levels associated with each path in the graph.

    - [ ] **Initial Pheromone Levels**: Initialize all pheromone levels to a small, positive constant to allow for initial exploration.

- [ ] **Pheromone Matrix Testing**: Ensure that the pheromone matrix correctly updates and retrieves values as intended.

### 3. Route Representation

- [ ] **Ant Solutions Structure**: Choose and implement a data structure (e.g., linked list) for representing the routes (solutions) generated by ants.

    - [ ] **Solution Initialization**: Develop methods to initialize and update ant solutions as they traverse the graph.

- [ ] **Solution Evaluation Method**: Create a function to evaluate the quality of an ant's solution based on distance and any relevant constraints.

### 4. Heuristic Information Storage

- [ ] **Utilize `MuxMuxHashTable`**: Store heuristic information, such as package deadlines and special instructions, using the hash table for quick access.

    - [ ] **Data Integration**: Populate the hash table with package information from the WGUPS system.

    - [ ] **Heuristic Function**: Develop a function that calculates heuristic values for paths based on stored information and current system states.

### 5. Component Integration Testing

- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Perform comprehensive testing to ensure that all initialized components work together as expected. This includes verifying that the graph, pheromone matrix, route representation, and heuristic information are all accessible and functionally integrated.

- [ ] **Debugging and Refinement**: Identify and resolve any issues discovered during integration testing. Refine component implementations as needed for efficiency and accuracy.

## Deliverables:

- A fully implemented adjacency matrix representing the WGUPS delivery area, complete with distance data.

- An initialized and functional pheromone matrix ready for dynamic updates during the ACO process.

- A data structure for ant solutions that supports route representation and manipulation.

- A `MuxMuxHashTable` filled with heuristic information relevant to package delivery requirements.

- Documentation and test results for all components, highlighting their integration and initial functionality within the WGUPS system.
