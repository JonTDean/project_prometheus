# Stage 5: Testing and Optimization

## Goals:
Ensure the ACO-integrated WGUPS system is reliable, meets delivery deadlines, and optimizes resources effectively. Identify and resolve any issues to improve system performance.

## Tasks:

### 1. Unit Testing

- [ ] **Component Tests**: Test individual components of the ACO system (e.g., graph representation, pheromone matrix, route selection) for correctness.

- [ ] **Hash Table Verification**: Confirm the integrity and performance of the `MuxMuxHashTable` in handling heuristic information.

- [ ] **Data Structure Integrity**: Ensure all chosen data structures (e.g., adjacency matrices, linked lists) operate as expected within the context of ACO.

### 2. System Testing

- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Validate the integration of the ACO algorithm with the WGUPS system, focusing on package assignment, delivery simulation, and status tracking.

- [ ] **Route Optimization Testing**: Assess the quality of the routes generated by ACO in terms of total distance traveled and adherence to delivery deadlines.

- [ ] **Load and Stress Testing**: Simulate scenarios with maximum package loads and tight delivery schedules to test the system's robustness.

### 3. Performance Tuning
- [ ] **Parameter Optimization**: Experiment with ACO parameters (e.g., number of ants, pheromone evaporation rate) to find settings that yield the best route optimizations.

- [ ] **Algorithmic Adjustments**: Make any necessary adjustments to the ACO algorithm or its implementation to improve efficiency and delivery outcomes.

- [ ] **Resource Utilization Analysis**: Examine the system's use of computational resources to identify potential optimizations.


## Deliverables:
- A suite of unit and system tests covering all aspects of the ACO-integrated WGUPS system.

- Documentation of testing procedures, results, and any identified issues along with their resolutions.

- A set of optimized parameters for the ACO algorithm ensuring efficient and effective route planning.
