# Stage 4: Integration with WGUPS System

## Goals:
Seamlessly integrate the ACO algorithm within the WGUPS system to optimize package delivery routes, taking into account trucks' capacities, drivers' availability, and delivery deadlines.

## Tasks:

### 1. Package Assignment to Trucks

- [ ] **Route Optimization Output Handling**: Ensure the ACO algorithm's output can be interpreted as delivery routes for trucks.

- [ ] **Package-to-Truck Allocation**: Develop logic to assign packages to trucks based on the optimized routes, considering package constraints (e.g., special notes, deadlines).

- [ ] **Load Balancing**: Implement algorithms to balance loads across available trucks, maximizing efficiency while adhering to capacity constraints.

### 2. Truck and Driver Simulation

- [ ] **Truck Initialization**: Instantiate truck objects with attributes for current location, speed, capacity, and assigned route.

- [ ] **Driver Assignment**: Link drivers to trucks, ensuring each truck in service has a driver. Implement logic for drivers to switch trucks if necessary.

- [ ] **Route Navigation**: Code the mechanism for trucks to follow ACO-optimized routes, updating their locations and delivering packages.

- [ ] **Time Management**: Simulate the passage of time within the delivery process, tracking the start and completion times of each delivery.

### 3. Time and Status Tracking for Packages

- [ ] **Status Update Mechanism**: Implement a system to update and track the status of each package (at the hub, en route, delivered) throughout the delivery process.

- [ ] **Delivery Time Recording**: Record the delivery time for each package, ensuring accuracy within the simulated environment.

### 4. Integration Testing

- [ ] **End-to-End System Tests**: Conduct tests to ensure the ACO algorithm, package assignment logic, and truck/driver simulation work together as intended.

- [ ] **Constraint Compliance Verification**: Verify that the system adheres to all specified constraints (e.g., package deadlines, truck capacities).

- [ ] **Scenario-Based Testing**: Test the system against specific delivery scenarios to ensure it behaves correctly under various conditions.

### 5. Performance Evaluation and Optimization

- [ ] **Efficiency Analysis**: Assess the efficiency of the delivery routes generated by the ACO algorithm in terms of total distance traveled and delivery times.

- [ ] **Algorithm Parameter Tuning**: Fine-tune ACO parameters (e.g., number of ants, pheromone evaporation rate) for optimal performance within the WGUPS system.

- [ ] **System Optimization**: Identify and address any bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the package assignment and delivery simulation processes.

## Deliverables:

- A fully integrated system where the ACO algorithm informs the loading and delivery strategies of the WGUPS delivery system.

- A simulation environment that realistically represents the delivery process, including truck movements, package deliveries, and time passage.

- A mechanism for tracking the status and delivery times of packages throughout the delivery process.

- Comprehensive integration testing documentation, detailing the system's adherence to constraints and its performance in various scenarios.
